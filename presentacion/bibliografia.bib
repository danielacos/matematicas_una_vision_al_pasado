	volume = {234},
	abstract = {Numerical schemes to approximate the Cahn–Hilliard equation have been widely studied in recent times due to its connection with many physically motivated problems. In this work we propose two type of linear schemes based on different ways to approximate the double-well potential term. The ﬁrst idea developed in the paper allows us to design a linear numerical scheme which is optimal from the numerical dissipation point of view meanwhile the second one allows us to design unconditionally energy-stable linear schemes (for a modiﬁed energy). We present ﬁrst and second order in time linear schemes to approximate the CH problem, detailing their advantages over other linear schemes that have been previously introduced in the literature. Furthermore, we compare all the schemes through several computational experiments.},

	title = {Numerical simulation of a thermodynamically consistent four-species tumor growth model},
	volume = {28},
	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a thermodynamically consistent four-species model of tumor growth based on the continuum theory of mixtures. Unique to this model is the incorporation of nutrient within the mixture as opposed to being modeled with an auxiliary reaction-diﬀusion equation. The formulation involves systems of highly nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations of surface eﬀects through diﬀuse-interface models. A mixed ﬁnite element spatial discretization is developed and implemented to provide numerical results demonstrating the range of solutions this model can produce. A time-stepping algorithm is then presented for this system which is shown to be ﬁrst order accurate and energy-gradient stable. The results of an array of numerical experiments are presented that demonstrate a wide range of solutions produced by various choices of model parameters.},
